Design pannel changes according to what we select
If we select background we have color
If we select a object like a chief hat we can change its proportions, size etc

- left and top - it helps us design RWD as we can create object that will be always on the same position from left/right top/bottom

- in layer we can control color and opacity
- we can add fill on top of a fill

If we add two or more fills we can go to color again to add the direction and breakpoints for the gradient

We can also add a image as a fill here

- fill
  we can have multiple fills. It is usefull to have for example fill with a opaity layer like a mask. Fill as a black under the text on the menu. And main fill that is the image

If we have a image as a fill we have a lot of options like exposure, contrast etc

Holding shift we can select multiple items. On top of pane we have icons for diffrent aligments of those items

## text

- we can decide to which portion of the bounding box the text will clip
- letter spacing and line height

## export

each object can be exported
We can decide on resolution and even export one file in multiple resolutions

On top right we can export all files in bulk
