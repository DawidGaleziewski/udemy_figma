- Color picker -> edit -> pic color
- Set default style -> edit -> set default style - every time we create object of that type ie rectangle it gets that style

- copy/paste properties (ctr + alt + c) - we can copy all properties this way from one object to another

## select tools

### edit

we can select object with same style or only with one same property like fill
We can select object with the text and change the same text in all artboards at once

### view

if we have a frame we can add pixel view to see individual pixels
Pixel preview - if we rotate the image it will show us that on a device it will get blurred

## object

- grouping objects together
- creating a re-usable componets for future use
- resize to fit - making object fit the frame
- bringing forward/backwords on z - axis
- flatten - if object is rottated we will adjust its parameters to the frame
- outline stroke - will convert a stroke to a outline. So we can for example shape the border of a box
- duplicate object ctr + d
- lock - if we want the object to stay as it is so we wont accidentally change it

## vector

when we use tools like pen it helps us working with nodes, joining nodes etc

## help

- search - we can simply find a option we need here!
- developer tools!
