## shapes

Inside shape like rectangle we have nodes we can move to change radius
We can change one node only by holding alt key
Holding shif will constrain our lines to 45deg

- shift + alt - starts resizing eclipse from the point we clicked
- if we click on the shape inside we will have nodes that help us manipulate the object i.e:
  - create a pie chart from eclipse
  - create a dounut chart
