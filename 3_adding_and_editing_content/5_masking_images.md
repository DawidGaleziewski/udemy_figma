To create a mask
Create two shapes, rectangle and rectangle with fill.
After that select both and click on top "use as mask"

Now the mask will cut picture coming out of the rectangle and we can place the picture exactly as we want inside the area

For example we an zoom in image and rotate it

Another way of cropping image is by going to the fill option of the image -> cropp

we can also cropp images inside a shape

# drop shaddow

Can be added in effects tab.
It is good to add two shadows one sharper and second bigger with bigger blur radius
