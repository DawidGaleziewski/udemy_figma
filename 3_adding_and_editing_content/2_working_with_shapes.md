- We can move shapes 10px at a time by holding shift + left/top arrows
- we can copy alements by holding alt and dragging

## creating union selection

If we join couple shapes we can select them and go to top -> union selection.
This will help us create one shape.

## rotate element

hold shift and hover on the corner

!!!HOLD ALT TO SEE THE RULERS when item is selected

## scaling vs resizing

if we want to scale somthing so that it wont lose params like border radius we should go to top lefts scaling tool and not just drag it.

## CUTTING HELEMENTS - subtracting

If we put rectangle on a star and go to union tools we can then select subtract to remove the area that the rectangle was taking

- union - combines shapes
- subtract - subtracts one shape from another
- intersect - leaves only the place that the shapes join
- exclude - cuts the place that elements are joined

!one quirk to remember is that in order to snap shapes we need to select them individualy otherwise the element wont snap to another elements
